# WebMiddle

> Node.js JSX framework for modular web scraping and data integration 

WebMiddle is a Node.js framework for extracting, transforming and combining data from multiple websites and web APIs.

WebMiddle applications can range from simple web scrapers to complex web integration tools targeting JSON APIs, raw HTML pages, XML resources and so on.

WebMiddle applications are written in a declarative, functional and modular way, by using their most evident aspect: **[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) services**.

Each service executes one task, or controls the execution of other tasks, by composing together other services in a tree-like fashion.

```jsx
function Main(props) {
  const { sites } = props;
  return (
    <Pipe>
      <Parallel name="articlesBySite">
        {sites.map(siteName => {
          const siteWebMiddle = siteWebMiddles[siteName];
          return (
            <SiteMain
              {...props}
              site={siteWebMiddle}
              name={siteName}
            />
          );
        })}
      </Parallel>

      {({ articlesBySite }) =>
        <MergeArticles
          name="articles"
          articlesBySite={articlesBySite}
        />
      }
    </Pipe>
  );
}
```

Each service can be registered with a **webmiddle**, which is similar to a WEB API: a collection of services, each with its own endpoint, that can be called to execute the service at that endpoint with the given parameters.

A webmiddle exposes settings accessible by all of its services and can be easily turned into an actual REST API for remote access.

Services registered with remote webmiddles can be used locally as if they were regular services, allowing seamless development of distributed applications.

## Examples

- [The site webmiddle for The New York Times](https://github.com/Maluen/webmiddle-site-nytimes)
- [The site webmiddle for Fox News](https://github.com/Maluen/webmiddle-site-foxnews)
- [WebMiddle application for searching articles from news sites](https://github.com/Maluen/webmiddle-project-search-news)

## Getting started

You can use [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) to quickly scaffold a new project:

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-webmiddle
yo webmiddle
```

-> [Learn more](https://webmiddle.github.io/docs/getting_started.html)

## JSX services

In terms of syntax, they are very similar to [react stateless functional components](https://medium.com/@housecor/react-stateless-functional-components-nine-wins-you-might-have-overlooked-997b0d933dbc#.91r5f1ish):

```jsx
const FetchPageLinks = ({ url, query, waitFor }) =>
  <Pipe>
    <Browser
      name="rawHtml"
      contentType="text/html"
      url={url}
      waitFor={waitFor}
    />

    {({ rawHtml }) =>
      <HtmlToJson name="result" from={rawHtml}>
        <anchors
          el="a"
          condition={el =>
            el.text().toUpperCase().indexOf(query.toUpperCase()) !== -1
          }
        >
          {elMap(el => (
            <anchor el={el}>
              <url>{elAttr('href')}</url>
              <text>{elText()}</text>
            </anchor>
          ))}
        </anchors>
      </HtmlToJson>
    }
  </Pipe>
);

FetchPageLinks.propTypes = {
  url: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  query: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  waitFor: PropTypes.string,
};
```

**Yes, you got this right, JSX for defining application logic!**

Calling the previous service with

```jsx
<FetchPageLinks
  url="https://news.ycombinator.com/"
  query="javascript"
/>
```

Will give an output like the following

```json
{
  "root": {
    "anchors": [
      {
        "anchor": {
          "url": "http://nearley.js.org/",
          "text": "Nearley â€“ parser toolkit for JavaScript"
        }
      },
      {
        "anchor": {
          "url": "https://sekao.net/blog/industry.html",
          "text": "ClojureScript is the most-used functional language that compiles to JavaScript"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Services are the building blocks of the webmiddle framework, they can be defined and composed to perform all the web data integration tasks.

[Pipe](/packages/webmiddle-service-pipe), [Browser](/packages/webmiddle-service-browser) and [HtmlToJson](/packages/webmiddle-service-cheerio-to-json) are all core services, however there is no actual difference between a core service and a service that you may want to develop yourself.  

This means that anyone can contribute by adding new services for doing the more disparate things!

## Remote execution

WebMiddle objects can be easily turned into REST APIs by using the `webmiddle-server` package, allowing remote access via HTTP.

Suppose you have the following webmiddle:

```javascript
import WebMiddle from 'webmiddle';

const textResource = (content, name = 'result') => ({
  name,
  contentType: 'text/plain',
  content: (typeof content !== 'undefined' && content !== null) ? String(content) : content,
});

const webmiddle = new WebMiddle({
  services: {
    divide: ({ a, b }) => textResource(a / b),
    multiply: ({ a, b }) => textResource(a * b),
  },
});
```

Turn it into a server listening on port 3000:

```javascript
import Server from 'webmiddle-server';

const server = new Server(webmiddle, { port: 3000 });
server.start();
```

In another machine, you can then use the `webmiddle-client` package to create a replica of the webmiddle run by the server, and execute its services remotely, the nice thing is that almost nothing will change in term of usage, it will be just like using a normal local webmiddle:

```javascript
import webmiddleClient from 'webmiddle-client';
import WebMiddle, { evaluate, createContext } from 'webmiddle';

webmiddleClient('http://localhost:3000/') // "localhost" since we are using the same machine in this example
.then(webmiddleRemote => {
  const Multiply = webmiddleRemote.service('multiply');

  evaluate(createContext(webmiddleRemote, { retries: 2 }),
    <Multiply
      a={10}
      b={20}
    />
  ).then(result => {
    console.log(result); // { name: 'result', contentType: 'text/plain', content: '200' }
  });
})
.catch(err => {
  console.log(err && err.stack || err);
});
```

## Multiple layers

A typical webmiddle application is composed of multiple layers, each made of one or more webmiddle objects:

## Core features

Features currently provided via the core packages:

- **Concurrency**, for executing multiple asynchronous services at the same time.
- **HTTP** requests.
- **PhantomJS** requests, for SPAs and pages using client-side generated content.
- **Cookie JAR**, for sharing cookies among different services and webmiddle objects.
- **Caching**, for resuming work in case of crash.
- **Error handling**, via customizable retries and catch options.
- **Data conversion** from/to multiple formats.
  - Currently HTML/XML/JSON to JSON.
  - New formats can be easily added by targeting the apposite "virtual" intermediate format.

## Open source ecosystem

Create your own services and webmiddles and share them with the community as node modules!

One of the main philosophies of the framework is **reuse**, by creating an ecosystem where webmiddles for websites, services, converters and so on can be published as separate npm modules, so that they can be used in other projects.

**NOTE**: If you think that a service / feature is so common and general that it should be in the core, [open an issue](https://github.com/webmiddle/webmiddle/issues/new) or just do a pull request!

## Future improvements

Here is a list of important features that are still missing and that should be in the core in the future:
- Proxy support
- HTTP/OAuth Authentication
- Redirects management
- Advanced logging and debugging
- Easy form submissions
- Access to queried server headers
- Delays and timeouts

## Contributing

This is a monorepo, i.e. all the core services and the main webmiddle package are all in this single repository.
It is inspired by [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) and other projects, check out this [article](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md) to know why this isn't an horrible idea after all.

It uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for managing the monorepo, as you might have guessed from the lerna.json file.
You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install --global lerna
```

Once this is done, install all the dependencies and link the packages together by running:

```bash
lerna boostrap
```

Each [package](https://github.com/webmiddle/webmiddle/tree/master/packages) uses the same build / test system.

Once you are inside a package folder, you can build it by running `npm run build` or `npm run build:watch` (for rebuilding on every change).

Tests use [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava), thus they can be written in modern JavaScript, moreover they will also run concurrently.
You can run the tests via `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`. The latter option is highly recommended while developing, as it also produces a much more detailed output.

For running the same npm command in each package, use `lerna run`, example:

```bash
lerna run build
```

For running arbitrary commands, use `lerna exec`, example:

```bash
lerna exec -- rm -rf ./node_modules
```

See [Lerna commands](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#commands) for more info.
